The project will involve implementing a fullstack application, applying various frontend technologies and best practices, and demonstrating proficiency in building user interfaces. I would be building a social blogging web application using Next.js, TypeScript, RTK (Redux Toolkit), Framer.js, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB as the database involves several components and considerations. Would go through system design, best practices, testing, and performance optimization techniques.
